# About

This is test task for SMART,

## Requirements:

1. Fetch All Users:
   • Use the endpoint GET /users from JSONPlaceholder to retrieve the list of all
   users. Documentation: JSONPlaceholder
2. Display Users in a Table:
   • Implement a table with columns: name, username, email, and phone.
3. Implement Advanced Filtering:
   • Add search input fields for each column (name, username, email, phone).
   • Ensure that the table dynamically filters results based on user input in these
   fields, with real-time updates.
4. State Management:
   • Use Redux to manage the application state, including user data and filter
   states. You can choose between Classic Redux or Redux Toolkit for this task.
5. Type Safety:
   • Apply TypeScript comprehensively across the entire web application to ensure
   proper typing and reduce potential runtime errors. This includes all aspects of
   the application’s functionality.
6. Design and Styling:
   Design the table and search inputs to be user-friendly and visually appealing. The styling
   is up to you, aiming for a clean and effective user interface.

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
